this is a dedication to & documentation of my commitment to the OSSU track,

this repo is for my finished assignment of the Systematic Program Design course /Core CS Section

I just started uploading by the end of Module 2

there's a guy on gihub @s7oev who got the essential files documented, which you're going to need to keep up with the course homework & assignments (since the free version of the course, the one on Edx, is archived -> files can't be viewed or downloaded)

thank you!
