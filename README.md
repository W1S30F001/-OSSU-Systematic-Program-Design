/OSSU/Core CS/1. SPD

all projects/exercises of this course are written in Racket, you can run it using drracket code editor

my personal coolest work is in the [advanced] folder

dedicated to & a documentation of my commitment to the OSSU track,

there's a guy on gihub @s7oev who got the essential files documented, which you're going to need to keep up with the course homework & assignments (since the free version of the course, the one on Edx, is archived -> files can't be viewed or downloaded) -> or get em from here (starter files only ig) https://github.com/ossu/spd-starters

thank you!
